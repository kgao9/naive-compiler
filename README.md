# naive-compiler
This is just a naive compiler
All it does is parse symbols and stores all symbols in a stack

The idea of it is you have your different scopes.
Each scope is a hash map of name: symbolObj.
You can remove and add scopes and add declarations and such.
It's actually not that exceiting, and the toString methods are a bit trivial.
